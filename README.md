# Ecommerce-Web-Application

I finished one Angular course from Udemy, and with all knowledge I gained, I made an application for E-Commerce. 
This application has different functionality that you find in a real online shop.

**The app is not finished yet, so it's more like a prototype.**

## What I learned?
I learned a lot about how to use Angular for the frontend and its functionalities: work with components, services.

## Technologies
Javascript + Angular for frontend, Java + Spring Boot for backen and MySql for database management.

## Functionalities & Some Photos
